# A demo of spatial SQL with data from Huricane Irma and the counties of Florida

The datasets used in this demo were downloaded from the the [United State Census Bureau](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2017-state-florida-current-county-subdivision-state-base) and the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/index.php?season=2017&basin=atl)

The SQL-Queries are not in any way performance optimized and are merely used to create a pretty output in the Spatial Results Tab of SQL Server Management Studio.

If you want to run the provided SQL-Queries or your own SQL-Queries restore the database backup file in this repository locally on your machine.
To Login in the restored database use username `sa` and password `dva-sem-22`.
